# Facial Recognition and Attendance System

This project implements a real-time facial recognition and attendance system using Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library. It detects faces via webcam, compares them with known faces, and logs attendance automatically.

---

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Logs attendance with timestamps in a CSV file.
- Highlights recognized faces in green and unknown faces in red.
- Adjustable webcam brightness using a trackbar.
- Supports multiple known faces.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faisal-ajao/facial-recognition-and-attendance.git
cd facial-recognition-and-attendance

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Face Recognition
Run:
```
python basic_face_recognition.py
```
- Compares `elon.jpg` with `elon_test.jpg` and displays face rectangles and distance scores.

### Attendance Project
Run:
```
python attendance_project.py
```
- Opens webcam, recognizes faces, and logs attendance in `attendance.csv`.
